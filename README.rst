In the examples directory you can find several Jupyter notebooks with specific
applications of poliastro. You can launch a cloud Jupyter server using `binder`_ to edit
the notebooks without installing anything. Try it out!

Requirements
============

poliastro requires the following Python packages:

* NumPy, for basic numerical routines
* Astropy, for physical units and time handling
* numba (optional), for accelerating the code
* jplephem, for the planetary ephemerides using SPICE kernels
* matplotlib, for orbit plotting
* plotly, for 2D and 3D interactive orbit plotting
* SciPy, for root finding and numerical propagation

poliastro is usually tested on Linux, Windows and OS X on Python
3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 against latest NumPy.

FAQ
===

What's up with the name?
------------------------

poliastro comes from Polimi, which is the shortened name of the Politecnico di
Milano, the Italian university where I was studying while writing this
software. It's my tiny tribute to a place I came to love. *Grazie mille!*

Can I do <insert awesome thing> with poliastro?
-----------------------------------------------

poliastro is focused on interplanetary applications. This has two consequences:

* It tries to be more general than other Flight Dynamics core libraries more
  focused on Earth satellites (see `Related software`_ for a brief list),
  allowing the algorithms to work also for orbits around non-Earth bodies.
* It leaves out certain features that would be too Earth-specific, such as
  TLE reading, SGP4 propagation, groundtrack plotting and others.

What's the future of the project?
---------------------------------

poliastro is actively maintained and receiving an influx of new contributors
thanks to the generous sponsorship of Google and the European Space Agency.
The best way to get an idea of the roadmap is to see the `Milestones`_ of
the project.
